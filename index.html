<p>This is a ComputerCraft Os system for everyday and advanced users. A though still in the making there are meany features. this includes and Error log and image and program manning. And simple login and Password setup. With a desktop much like windows you can put files where every you like and change there appearances easily and efficiently. </p>

<p>Meany people ask me what this is used for. in general its for the average moded Minecraft player that wishes to do something with Computer Craft but does not what to get to involved with learning to code and move about the computer.</p>
